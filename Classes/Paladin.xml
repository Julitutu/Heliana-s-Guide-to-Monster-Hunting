		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Harvest attracts paladins who wish to nourish and heal the world. Often found on aid missions to war-torn lands, such paladins resort to harm only as a means of preventing further suffering. Paladins who swear this oath are more likely than not to heal, feed, and nurture a wounded foe, provided the defeated creature gives its word of honour that it will cease its nefarious activities. They are no fools, however. Typically versed in religion and medicine, these paladins are unlikely to believe the word of creatures inherently inclined to lie, or those that have previously broken their word.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Tenets of the Harvest</b></p>
			<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Harvest inspire their followers to seek out potential harm and quell it before it blossoms.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Share Your Meal.</i></b> Your powers are a gift to be shared; if someone is in need, you must use your power to meet those needs. To eat your fill while another goes hungry is selfish.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Nurture Over Cure.</i></b> Act in the greatest interest of the many. Find ways to prevent harm before it must be healed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Permit Prosperity.</i></b> Whether in matters of love, politics, or war, always give your antagonist the opportunity to change and redeem themselves before casting a fatal judgment. A good meal can serve as the backdrop to such events.</p>

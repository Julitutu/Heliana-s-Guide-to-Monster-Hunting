			<p>Through careful preparation, trappers can create both physical and magical traps to ensnare, explode, or enrapture those unlucky enough to find themselves in their vicinity. Trappers are found in all terrains where there are creatures to be hunted. With tact and guile as their companions, a trapper can lay low even the mightiest of prized beasts.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, and later at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, you learn how to make new traps, as detailed on the Trapper Traps table, below. Details of these traps can be found on pages 192 - 194.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Physical Traps.</i></b> Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap’s description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the trap can’t be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap’s construction if it hasn’t activated yet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Magical Traps.</i></b> Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the Ranger Traps section on page 192. Some of these traps require you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.</p>
			<p class="indent">While a physical trap’s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance of an armed trap, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate an armed magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Deploying a Trap.</i></b> As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Disarming a Trap.</i></b> Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves’ tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap’s effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Trap Effects.</i></b> Spell effects created by a trap don’t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the detect magic spell can notice a magical trap’s presence, even if it has been concealed.</p>

			<p>The merest hiss of escaping air, depression of a tile, or scent of ozone is all the warning you need to avoid traps’ effects. When you are subjected to a trap’s activation effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. In addition, if a trap makes an attack roll against you, that attack roll has disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">This feature doesn’t function against a trap’s ongoing effects. For example, you can mitigate the effect of a poisonous cloud as it is being released by holding your breath or covering your skin, but on subsequent rounds, the cloud’s saving throw would affect you as normal on a success or failure.</p>

			<p>You trap your own body against unexpected demise. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of the following magical effects with which to augment your body until you finish a long rest. After triggering an effect that activates when you are reduced to 0 hit points, that effect can’t trigger again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Defibrillate.</i></b> Once per turn, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger an electrical discharge (no action required). The creature is unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn unless it is immune to lightning damage, and you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. After you move using this feature, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. If you don’t regain any hit points before the end of your next turn, you drop to 0 hit points, fall unconscious, and begin making death saving throws as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Dissolve.</i></b> Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a spurt of acid to coat its weapon or limb (no action required). If the melee attack was a spell attack or made with a natural weapon, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage. If the result of the attack roll meets your AC and is made with a ferrous, non-magical, non-natural weapon, the acid causes the metal to weaken and the weapon is destroyed.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you are reduced to 0 hit points, all your concealed acid charges gush outward. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and an additional 5d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns for the next minute until it uses an action to wipe itself clean. In addition, on a failure, if the creature rolled a 1 on the d20 for its saving throw and is wearing nonmagical, ferrous armour, the armour seizes. While wearing the armour, the creature’s speed is halved, its AC is reduced by 2, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Entomb.</i></b> Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can trigger a burst of cold that ripples along the attacker’s limb (no action required). The creature takes 1d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 15 feet until the end of its next turn unless it is immune to cold damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you become entombed in a block of clear ice that has AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. This icy block lasts for 1 minute or until it is destroyed. While the ice persists, you have total cover against all effects and you don’t make death saving throws. If you regain 1 or more hit points, the icy block melts at the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Self-Destruct.</i></b> Once per turn, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can cause a small, shaped charge to detonate (no action required). You take 1 fire damage and the creature takes 1d8 fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you erupt in an immense ball of fire and immediately fail one death saving throw. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC.

			<description >The bear trap’s non-lethal cousin, the snare trap, tangles a creature’s feet, causing it to fall. You trap a 5-foot square with ropes and vines. When a Large or smaller creature moves into the trapped area, the trap activates and the creature must succeed on a DC {{set trap:dc}} Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, and its speed becomes 0 feet unless it’s immune to being grappled. A creature can use its action to make a DC {{set trap:dc}} Strength (Athletics) check, freeing the trapped creature on a success.</description>

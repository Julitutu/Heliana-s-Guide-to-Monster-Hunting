		<description>
			<p>Flourishing a gilded skull snatched from within the folds of a cloak, a dwarf summons a fierce-eyed angel in a flare of blinding radiance, emphatically encouraging it to fantastical feats of fury.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beaming from ear to ear, a chemical-stained gnome admires her handiwork amongst the clutter of her laboratory: a ‘snektopus’; eight venom-fanged maws perfectly spliced with the intelligence of a cephalopod.</p>
			<p class="indent">Coughing in the smoking ruins of the cultists’ former hideout, a tiefling gives their fire-infused owlbear a playful rub behind the ears, contemplating a job well done and the rewards to be claimed.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the ‘very tiny stitches’ of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A TAMER</h4>
			<p>What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch ‘em all?</p>
			<p class="indent">The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other’s innermost thoughts. However, such bonds differ between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.</p>

		<requirements>!ID_INTERNAL_FEATURE_REPLACEMENT_HGTMH_TAMER_POCKET_FAMILIAR</requirements>
		<description>
			<p><em>1st-level Tamer feature</em></p>
			<p>You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies.</p>
			<p><strong>Vessel.</strong> When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel. If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.</p>
			<div class="sidebar"> 
			<h5>Home Planes</h5>
			<p>Some magical effects, like the banishment spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel.</p></div>
			<p><strong>Summoning.</strong> As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
			<h5>Dominated Companions</h5>
			<p>A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the dominate monster spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, it is recalled, while on a success, it is not.</p></div>
			<p><strong>Combat.</strong> In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to.</p>
			<p><strong>Rest.</strong> A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.</p>
			<p><strong>Items.</strong> Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type.</p>
			<p><strong>Item Bonding.</strong> Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement, page 238).</p>
			<p><strong>Companion Barding.</strong> You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape.</p>

			<p>As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DCs.</p>
			<p><strong>Training.</strong> Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).</p>
			<p>Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these.</p>
			<p>Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer.</p>

			<p class="indent"><i>*E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet.</i></p>

When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons.</i></p>
			<p class="indent"><i>***Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.</i></p>
			<div class="sidebar">
			<h5>Abilities and Proficiency</h5>
			<p>As your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modififiers, saving throws, attack modififiers, and saving throw DCs will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work.</p>
			<p>First you have to know the creature’s profificiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, subtract the creature’s PB from its modififiers/save DCs. For save DCs, subtract an additional 8 from the DC. Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modififiers.</p>
			<p>Let’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modififier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modififier), and the fifire breath uses Constitution (DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modififier).</p>
			<p>If the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modififier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively.</p>

			<description>As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DCs.
			Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).
			Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these.
			Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer.
			Companion Improvement Training Table
			Improvement Effect
			Speed Training: Increase one existing speed by 15 feet up to a maximum of 150% of the creature’s base speed, rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment*.
			Toughen Up: Your companion gains an additional Hit Die, increasing its hit point maximum. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).
			Ability Boost: Increase one of your companion’s ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.
			Go For the Throat: Your companion gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls made with its natural weapons or unarmed strikes**.
			Survival Instincts: Your companion gains proficiency in one saving throw.
			War Training: Your companion gains proficiency with one armour type or two weapons***.
			*E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet.
			**Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons.
			***Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.</description>

		<description>
			<p><em>1st-level Tamer feature</em></p>
			<p>One way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table.</p>
			<p><strong>Vessel. </strong> To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
			<h5>Vessels and Cost</h5>
			<p class="indent">At 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature.</p></div>
			<p><strong>Taming a Creature.</strong> As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm.</li>
				<li>It is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce).</li>
				<li>It has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table).</li>
				<li>It has a higher CR than the vessel can capture.</li>
				<li>It has more than half of its hit points.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
			<h5>Optional Rule: Non-Combat Taming</h5>
			<p>If a player impresses a celestial with an especially noble act, or rears a creature from an egg, that creature might be willing to become a tamer’s companion. If so, feel free to ignore the usual rules regarding saving throws on taming, and let the beautiful story of companionship unfold!</p>
			</div>
			<p><strong>Lost Traits.</strong> When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond, page 201).</li>
				<li>Any summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction).</li>
				<li>The Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits.</li>
				<li>Any effect that restores hit points, unless that effect has a limited number of uses per day.</li>
				<li>Any legendary actions, mythic traits, legendary action options, and mythic action options.</li>
				<li>Any lair actions and regional effects.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="sidebar">
			<h5>Powerful Companion Abilities</h5>
			<p>Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is difffferent, and some might not require changing.</p>
			<p><strong>Recharge Abilities.</strong> Some creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following:</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Recharge Condition Companion Recharge</h5>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td class="col-30" style="text-align:center">Recharge</td>
						<td class="col-30" style="text-align:center">Condition</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align:center">Recharge (4-6)</td>
						<td style="text-align:center">Recharges after 1 minute</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align:center">Recharge (5-6)</td>
						<td style="text-align:center">Recharges after 10 minutes</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align:center">Recharge (6)</td>
						<td style="text-align:center">Recharges on a short or long rest</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Perpetually Active Abilities.</strong> Some traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effffect, it is immune to the effffect for the next 24 hours”. Work with your GM to fifind a balanced solution for your game.</p>

Many Splicers delve into the world of adventuring in the hopes of discovering exciting new improvements with which to augment their companions. Your foray into the world of biomancy, whether through wizarding school, working with biosmith artificers, or as the surgical assistant to a mad scientist, has resulted in a singular observation: subjects are much more malleable when they’re psychically bonded to you.</p>

Each time you gain a level in the tamer class, you gain 1 additional splicer point. You can spend these points to modify your companions with the following augments—features and traits that take effect when you next finish a long rest. Splicer points are shared across all your companions. If a companion is ever released, it loses any augments it had and the splicer points are refunded. Augments can be gained only once unless otherwise stated. See the Splicer Augments table on the next page for more details.</p>

			<p>Whether it be some distant doppelganger heritage or over-exposure to biomantic magic, your body thrums with the potential for change. Though you may try to channel that power into those around you, the magic that inoculates your body is just as likely to change you, transforming you into a myriad of magical morphs. Will you end up with two left feet and paper-thin skin, or rake through your enemies with toxic claws as spells bounce off of your reflective carapace?</p>

			<p>Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a biomancy or transmutation spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell lists.</p>

			<p>Your spellcasting stimulates the latent changeability of your body. Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or lower than one-third of your sorcerer level (minimum 1), roll on the Skinshift Adaptations table to magically alter your body in a random way until the end of your next turn. Immediately after you roll on this table, you can spend 1 sorcery point (no action required) to extend the duration of the effect to 10 minutes. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your sorcerer spell save DC.</p>

            <p>A relatively recent creation, the gelatinous polyhedrooze builds on its forebears’ mere six sides. Able to more selectively dissolve the objects it engulfs, this companion makes use of the arms and armour found lying around dungeons to form impenetrable barriers of overlapping shields and phalanx-like spears.</p>
            <p>If any of the gelatinooze’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the gelatinooze’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the gelatinooze’s Strength modifier</p>

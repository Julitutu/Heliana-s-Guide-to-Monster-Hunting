			<p><b>Creature Component:</b> Aboleth or broodmother aboleth</p>
			<p><b>Bonus Tamer Improvement:</b> Genetic Memory and +2 Hit Dice</p>
			<p>Encoded within aboleth ichor are the memories of its donor, secreted amongst the fluid’s genetic code. In its base state, an aboling makes a functional amphibious companion, with a minor ability to sense the motives of other creatures.</p>
			<p>Upon bonding and training with a tamer, an aboling can fulfil its potential as a mind reader and repository of knowledge, sharing insights and information its progenitor acquired over its long life.</p>
			<p>If any of the aboling’s traits or actions require saving throws, it is always against the aboling’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
			<center>
				<p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the aboling’s Constitution modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h4>Monster Trainer</h4>
			<p>In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the aboling the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:</p>

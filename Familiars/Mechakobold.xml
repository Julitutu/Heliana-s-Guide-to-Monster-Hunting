            <p><b>Bonus Tamer Improvement:</b> Pack Tactics and +2 Hit Dice</p>
            <p>From the crude blood-oil of the mecha koboldzilla can be harnessed the progenitor genetic code of the modern kobold. A combination of flesh and metal, the mechakobold retains much of the modern kobold’s ingenuity and penchant for mischief. Mechakobolds’ belief powers their magical inventions; the force of their personality directly augments their creations. Expect homemade explosions, picked pockets, and the pressing of any big, red buttons.</p>
            <p>If any of the mechakobold’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the mechakobold’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the mechakobold’s Charisma modifier</p>

            <h4>Monster Trainer</h4>
            <p>In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the mechakobold the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:</p>

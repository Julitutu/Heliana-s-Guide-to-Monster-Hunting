                <p class="flavor">A helpful fungal friend, the hyphan’s climbing ability makes it especially useful for dusting those hard-to-reach corners. It’s also very good at stopping bar fights; it has a real calming presence. I just have to remember to put him in the basement when we want to really let loose and break some furniture.</p>

            <p><b>Creature Component:</b> Hyphan</p>
            <p><b>Bonus Tamer Improvement:</b> Helpful and +2 Hit Dice</p>
            <p>Always keen to offer aid, hyphans make excellent support companions, both on the battlefield and emotionally. Able to calm intense emotions, charm aggressors, and disappear into the earth, they are experts in de-escalation and can aid a party’s escape by lacing large areas with necrotising puffballs.</p>
            <p>If any of the hyphan’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the hyphan’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the hyphan’s Constitution modifier</p>

            <p>In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the hyphan the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:</p>

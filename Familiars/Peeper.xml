                <p class="flavor">Sometimes, after a trying fight, it’s nice to have a friend tell you that you did well. And if you don’t have a friend—sometimes they get incinerated—a bonded companion that can never leave you will do. Isn’t that right, Peeper? …Peeper? No! I didn’t mean to say you weren’t my friend! Of course you’re my friend. Peeper…</p>

            <p>Peepers are creatures of hope, optimism, and positive vibes. The ultimate cheerleaders, they are as cowardly as they are encouraging. Their overdeveloped survival instincts kick in whenever a large enough source of fear rears its harrowing head, causing them to flee without hesitation.</p>
            <p>If any of the peeper’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the peeper’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the peeper’s Constitution modifier</p>

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC {{peeper:dc}} Strength saving throw or the peeper can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of the peeper’s next turn or until the peeper is incapacitated.&#13;
            If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn’t being worn or carried, the peeper can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. The peeper can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container. After the peeper uses this action, it can’t do so again until its tamer finishes a short or long rest.</description>

            <p>Like a dragon, but a little less greedy and a little more pliant, dragonlings are Humperdink’s attempt at retaining a dragon’s useful characteristics and limiting the more… tyrannical ones. Able to shift its makeup depending on the metals to which it is exposed, the dragonling is an adaptable, if distractable, companion.</p>
            <p>If any of the dragonling’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the dragonling’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the dragonling’s Constitution modifier</p>
            </center>

            <p>Whenever the dragonling first detects treasure worth 100 gp or more that isn’t being worn or carried, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or get distracted. While distracted, it spends its movement and actions trying to get close to, and frolic in, the treasure. A distracted dragonling repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success and becoming immune to the allure of that treasure for the next 24 hours.</p>

            <p>As an action, the dragonling can beat its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragonling must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the dragonling’s Strength modifier) or take bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The damage equals 4d6 plus the dragonling’s Strength modifier. Creatures larger than the dragonling automatically succeed on this saving throw.

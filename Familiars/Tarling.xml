            <p><b>Bonus Tamer Improvement:</b> Growth I and +2 Hit Dice</p>
            <p>Tarlings can draw upon the arcane power source around which they’re crafted in order to enhance the decompositive powers innate to tar elementals. They can even manipulate the corpses of the deceased, puppeteering them as flesh suits that can absorb incoming blows. Biomancers posit that such companions can even assume the immense size of tarrasques for a short time.</p>
            <p>If any of the tarling’s traits or actions require a saving throw, it is always against the tarling’s save DC, as calculated below.</p>
            <center>
                <p><b>Save DC</b> = 8 + the tamer’s proficiency bonus + the tarling’s Constitution modifier</p>

            <p>In addition to the improvements you can normally give your companions, you can choose to grant the tarling the following improvements using your Monster Trainer feature:</p>

            <description action="Action" usage="1/Long Rest">As an action, the tarling can reanimate one corpse within 5 feet of it, merging its body with the corpse for the next hour. The corpse must have been a creature with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the tamer’s proficiency bonus and been of a size equal to or smaller than the tarling.&#13;
            For the duration, the tarling gains the non-flying speeds of the corpse’s original creature and has two pools of hit points: its own and those from the corpse it inhabits. The corpse’s pool of hit points equals half the original creature’s hit point maximum.&#13;
            Whenever the tarling takes damage, half of the damage is transferred to the corpse and subtracted from that pool of hit points instead of the tarling’s. If the corpse’s pool of hit points is reduced to 0, the reanimation ends and the corpse is destroyed. After the tarling uses this action, it can’t do so again until its tamer finishes a long rest.</description>

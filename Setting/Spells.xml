      <p>With a gentle patter, corrosive raindrops build to an acidic deluge in a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder, centred on a point within range. When the rain begins, each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on failure or half as much damage on a success. For the duration, a creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there.</p>
      <p><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the acid damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

      <p>You float some mildly distracting thoughts into the mind of a humanoid you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks (taking a -5 penalty to its passive Perception as a result of this disadvantage) until the spell ends. A creature immune to being charmed is unaffected by this spell.</p>
      <p>A creature that succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more is aware that an attempt was made to influence it with magic. Otherwise, the creature remains unaware of the magic that affected it.</p>

An affected creature ignores the effects of exhaustion, the poisoned condition, and cannot be incapacitated, stunned, paralysed, or fall unconscious.

    <description>
      <p>With an exhalation, fungal spores waft their way towards a point within range. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed until the spell ends.</p>
      <p>When you cast the spell, choose one of the following fungi to grow on the cursed creatures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Amanita Rotgut.</b> The creature immediately takes 2d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 2d6 poison damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns.</li>
        <li><b>Necrotising Zygomycosis.</b> The creature immediately takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and takes 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.</li>
        <li><b>Psilocybin Quickitrippiae.</b> The creature begins ‘tripping’. It must roll a d4 at the start of each of its turns. On a 1, the creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.</li>
        <li><b>Paralysing Mucorales.</b> At the end of each of the creature’s turns, it becomes stunned until the start of its next turn. If the creature fails a saving throw against this spell by 5 or more then, if it would be stunned, it is paralysed instead.</li>
        <li><b>Raging Henbane.</b> The creature becomes charmed by you and must use its reaction at the start of each of its turns to make one weapon attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach/range other than you.</li>
        <li><b>Veiled Lady.</b> The creature’s vision darkens to a pinhole; the creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and ranged attacks have advantage against the creature.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns (after the effects of this spell have triggered), ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
      <p><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) of Amanita Rotgut and Necrotising Zygomycosis increases by 1d6 and 1d8, respectively, for each slot level above 4th. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose two different fungi to grow on affected targets instead of one.</p>

      <p>You drain the life force of those around you, turning their limbs heavy and their bones cold. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw.

      <p>You touch one item, instilling it with levels of belief worthy of a kobold and granting it one of the following properties, based on the item type, for the duration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Armour.</b> A creature wearing this armour gains 1d4 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns.</li>
        <li><b>Belt.</b> A creature wearing this belt gains a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>
        <li><b>Boots.</b> A creature wearing these boots has its walking speed increased by 10 feet and its jump distance tripled.</li>
        <li><b>Cloak.</b> A creature wearing this cloak has advantage on Stealth checks it makes to hide and can hide while only lightly obscured.</li>
        <li><b>Gloves.</b> A creature wearing these gloves gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, it has advantage on any ability checks it makes related to grappling.</li>
        <li><b>Headwear.</b> A creature wearing this headwear doesn’t need to breathe, has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and has resistance to poison damage.</li>

      <p>You can end this spell early by touching the item. The spell ends if you cast it again.</p>

      <p>You spew a thick cloud of dense black smoke that forms a 5-foot-diameter, 10-foot-high cylinder centred on you that lasts until the start of your next turn. The smoke heavily obscures its area. When you cast the spell, you can choose whether the cloud remains in the location where you cast it or if it moves with you, centred on you.</p>
      <p>When you reach higher levels, the size of the cloud you can create with this spell increases. When you reach 5th level, the cloud has a maximum diameter and height of 15 feet; at 11th level this increases to 25 feet; and at 17th level this increases to 40 feet. You choose how big the cloud is in each dimension up to this maximum each time that you cast it.</p>

      <p>Choose a source of water that you can see within range that has a volume of at least 4 pints. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the source of water. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw, pulling it up to 10 feet towards the source of water on a failure.</p>
      <p>The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 and the distance it can pull a target increases by 5 feet when you reach 5th level (2d6 and 15 feet), 11th level (3d6 and 20 feet), and 17th level (4d6 and 25 feet).</p>

      <p>You attempt to redirect a spell cast by a creature you can see. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, you can redirect the spell. If the spell involves a ranged spell attack, you can cause the ranged spell attack to target a different target of your choice within 10 feet of its original target. If the spell has an area of effect, you can shift the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction. If the creature is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell is redirected as described.</p>
      <p><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell is automatically redirected as described if its level is less than the level of the spell slot you used.</p>

      <p>You imperceptibly tangle the threads of the Weave in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point you can see within range. Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher in this area, it must make an ability check with its spellcasting ability against your spell save DC.

      <p>Any additional spell cast this way targets or is centred on the spellcaster, who has no control over the spell’s effects. The DC for any saving throws equals the spellcaster’s spell save DC. In the case of concentration spells, no concentration is required. At initiative count 20 of each round, roll a d20 for each ongoing additional effect. On a roll of 11 or higher, that effect ends.</p>
      <p><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you increase the radius of the area affected by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.</p>

      <p>In response to a creature vocalizing, you make a sharp sound and hold a finger up in an attempt to interrupt them. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become silenced as its mouth is fused shut for the duration. If you silence a target that is casting a spell with verbal components, the target’s spell slot isn’t expended, but its action is wasted.</p>
      <p>At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw as it tries to tear open its mouth. On a success, the target takes 1d8 slashing damage and is no longer silenced. Alternatively, as an action, the target can use a bladed implement to cut open its mouth, taking 1d8 slashing damage and ending the silence.</p>

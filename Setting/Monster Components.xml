Because of their inherent magic, good nature, and tendency to disintegrate upon death, celestial components are both extremely rare and astoundingly valuable. Despite only a few mortals being able to claim they’ve seen them, unicorns are the most common celestial. Their horns and blood are prized for their rejuvenating and revivifying effects.</p>
            <p>Extraplanar Recall. As the bodies of celestials disintegrate upon death, shunting their souls back to their home plane, only pouches of dust can be harvested if the creature is killed anywhere other than its home plane or in a magic circle.</p>
            <p>Optional Rule: Supply &amp; Demand. Due to the rarity of celestial components, you can double their trade values.</p>

            <p>Elementals are conglomerations of elemental energy given thought. For this reason, little is left behind when they die. An astute and fast-acting harvester can capture the core of an elemental, though to do so is fraught with danger.</p>
            <p>Volatile Components: Elementals. If a character fails to harvest a volatile component, you can trigger one of the following events, the effects of which duplicate a spell but aren’t themselves spells. Use a save DC of 13 and 16 for the volatile mote and core, respectively. In all cases, only the harvesters are counted as being in the effect’s area, and all effects are instantaneous, ending immediately after triggering.</p>

        <description>
            <h4>Elemental</h4>
            <p>Elementals are conglomerations of elemental energy given thought. For this reason, little is left behind when they die. An astute and fast-acting harvester can capture the core of an elemental, though to do so is fraught with danger.</p>
            <p>Volatile Components: Elementals. If a character fails to harvest a volatile component, you can trigger one of the following events, the effects of which duplicate a spell but aren’t themselves spells. Use a save DC of 13 and 16 for the volatile mote and core, respectively. In all cases, only the harvesters are counted as being in the effect’s area, and all effects are instantaneous, ending immediately after triggering.</p>
            <p>The harvesters must save against:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Air elemental: the <i>lightning bolt</i> spell.</li>
                <li>Earth elemental: the <i>depth charge</i> spell (page 501).</li>
                <li>Fire elemental: the <i>fireball</i> spell.</li>
                <li>Water elemental: a wave of water with the effects of the <i>wind wall</i> spell.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fey</h4>
            <p>The fey are an emotive class of creature whose morphology encompasses the breadth of beasts, humanoids, and beyond. A magical component unique to fey is their psyche. This volatile, impulsive mass of emotion becomes detached from the minds of these especially charismatic creatures shortly after death. Any nearby creature can find itself the unwitting host of this cranial stowaway if it isn’t properly handled.</p>
            <p>Volatile Component: Possession. If harvesters start but do not finish harvesting a psyche, the carving harvester must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed by the fey’s psyche. The possessed creature is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The psyche now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The psyche can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effects, except ones that turn fey, and it retains its alignment and immunity to being charmed. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</p>
            <p>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the psyche ends it as a bonus action, or the psyche is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the psyche disappears into the ether.</p>
            <p><b>Edible and used in crafting</b></p>
            <p>Regarding edible components: antennae can be used as eyes.</p>

            <h4>Fey</h4>
            <p>The fey are an emotive class of creature whose morphology encompasses the breadth of beasts, humanoids, and beyond. A magical component unique to fey is their psyche. This volatile, impulsive mass of emotion becomes detached from the minds of these especially charismatic creatures shortly after death. Any nearby creature can find itself the unwitting host of this cranial stowaway if it isn’t properly handled.</p>
            <p>Volatile Component: Possession. If harvesters start but do not finish harvesting a psyche, the carving harvester must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed by the fey’s psyche. The possessed creature is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The psyche now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The psyche can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effects, except ones that turn fey, and it retains its alignment and immunity to being charmed. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</p>
            <p>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the psyche ends it as a bonus action, or the psyche is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the psyche disappears into the ether.</p>
            <p>These items are used only for monster-forged items in this book.</p>

            <h4>Fiend</h4>
            <p>The antithesis of celestials, fiends creep out of the Lower Planes to cause chaos and suffering, tricking humanoids into forfeiting their souls. The components of fiends are separated into three subtypes: demon, devil, and yugoloth, corresponding with their creature subtype tags. The chaos that pervades the body of a demon provides remarkably different properties to the deceit that runs through a devil’s veins.</p>
            <p>Extraplanar Recall. As fiends’ bodies disintegrate upon death, shunting their souls back to their home plane, only pouches of dust can be harvested if the creature is killed anywhere other than on its home plane or in a magic circle.</p>

            <h4>Monstrosity</h4>
            <p>Though monstrosities may appear to resemble beasts or humanoids, they share one key difference: the origin of all monstrosities is magical. While humans may have evolved from dumb apes to slightly- less-dumb apes (with a little prodding from the gods), monstrosities were magicked into life. An apt example is the owlbear; though seemingly a simple bestial chimera, the magic that brought it about renders it immune to the lesser spells that might affect true beasts. For this reason, monstrosities yield some of the most useful magical components found without leaving the Material Plane.</p>

            <p>Though monstrosities may appear to resemble beasts or humanoids, they share one key difference: the origin of all monstrosities is magical. While humans may have evolved from dumb apes to slightly- less-dumb apes (with a little prodding from the gods), monstrosities were magicked into life. An apt example is the owlbear; though seemingly a simple bestial chimera, the magic that brought it about renders it immune to the lesser spells that might affect true beasts. For this reason, monstrosities yield some of the most useful magical components found without leaving the Material Plane.</p>

            <h4>Monstrosity</h4>
            <p>Though monstrosities may appear to resemble beasts or humanoids, they share one key difference: the origin of all monstrosities is magical. While humans may have evolved from dumb apes to slightly- less-dumb apes (with a little prodding from the gods), monstrosities were magicked into life. An apt example is the owlbear; though seemingly a simple bestial chimera, the magic that brought it about renders it immune to the lesser spells that might affect true beasts. For this reason, monstrosities yield some of the most useful magical components found without leaving the Material Plane.</p>

			<p>The versatility of the magically-enhanced ooze used to craft this flail can’t be overstated. Its high tensile strength allows its ‘chain’ to stretch in response to its wearer’s thoughts, while the flail’s head boasts a hardness and density comparable to steel.</p>
			<p class="indent">This magic flail deals an extra 1d6 acid damage to the first target it hits on each of your turns. The flail has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reachier.</em></strong> While holding the flail, you can expend up to 4 charges (no action required) to increase your reach with this weapon by 5 feet for each charge expended until the end of your turn.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Reachier.</em></strong> While holding the flail, you can expend up to 4 charges (no action required) to increase your reach with this weapon by 5 feet for each charge expended until the end of your turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Very rare variant:</em></strong> The flail deals an extra 1d8 acid damage to any target it hits, instead of the first target you hit on each of your turns. The flail gains the Sticky Fingers property.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sticky Fingers.</em></strong> When you hit a Medium or smaller creature that is holding a weapon or item with an attack using the flooze, you can choose to disarm it of one weapon instead of dealing damage to it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or let go of its item, which becomes stuck in the flail. A creature within reach of the flooze can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength check, liberating the stuck weapon on a success. Success or failure, a creature takes 1d4 acid damage when it takes this action. The flail can only hold 2 weapons at a time, and a nonmagical weapon that remains in the flail for 1 minute is completely dissolved. While the flail has weapons in it, you can choose to deal your choice of piercing or slashing damage with it on each hit, instead of the usual bludgeoning damage.</p>

	<element name="Bonze's Bokken, Wind Ripper" type="Magic Item" source="Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting" id="ID_LT_HGTMH_BONZE_BOKKEN_WIND_RIPPER_UNCOMMON">
		<description>
			<p>Hermits of the Springwood, the bonze have as much in common with a druid’s love of nature as with the discipline and ritual of the monk. They do not deign to shed the blood of other creatures and thus imbue their training swords, known as bokken, with the power to propel them out of harm’s way. The thunderous wind rip is really just a tool for releasing hard-to-reach fruit.</p>
			<p>This magic weapon has <b>5 charges</b> and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. It deals bludgeoning damage instead of a sword’s normal slashing or piercing damage.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Gale.</em></strong> As an action, you can cause a cube of air up to 15 feet on a side to blow with a strong wind until the end of your next turn, dispersing any gasses.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Wind Rip.</em></strong> With a swish, you can send a concussive wave of sound streaking towards a target. When you take the Attack action while holding this blade, you can make ranged spell attacks known as ‘wind rips’ with the bokken. Wind rips have a range of 30/60 ft., +5 to hit, deal 1d8 thunder damage on a hit, and can be heard up to 100 feet away. On a critical hit, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. You can make as many wind rips as you have attacks.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Sinew harvested from a suneater owlbear’s spine can imbue arrows with low-level radiation, which is passed onto a target when struck by the ammunition. The magic of suneater respiration lies in their photometabolism; they can convert sunlight into pure, concentrated radiant energy, unleashing unholy beams of destructive force.</p>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Sunshot.</em></strong> While in sunlight, this bow doesn’t need ammunition. If you draw this weapon’s bowstring without nocking an arrow, it produces its own ammunition, automatically creating a radiant arrow when you make a ranged attack with it. The attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon’s normal damage. The arrow created by this weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Irradiation.</em></strong> A creature that takes radiant damage from this bow becomes magically marked for 1 hour. During this time, it leaves an invisible trail that can be seen by creatures with truesight or creatures using the <em>detect magic</em> spell. The trail fades after 1 hour.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The shapechanging abilities of the mimic infuse this musical instrument, a lute, with the propensity to subtly alter its shape and produce excellent acoustics. It also exudes a corrosive acid that can be a useful addition when the musician’s plan to charm a foe with a sweet serenade doesn’t go to plan.</p>
			<p>This magic weapon deals an additional 1d8 acid damage to the first target that it hits on a turn. If you have proficiency with lutes, you’re considered proficient with this weapon as well.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Ventriloquism.</em></strong> As a bonus action while holding the lute, you can command it to mimic simple sounds it has been exposed to, such as a person whispering, swords clashing, or simple melodies. You can choose for the sounds to originate from any point within 30 feet of you that you can see. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they’re imitations with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>

A creature that hears the sounds can tell they’re imitations with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Club Music.</em></strong> As an action while holding the lute, you can play one of two brief but powerful songs. Once a song has been played, you can’t play that song again until the next dawn.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Panic! at the Tavern.</strong> You let loose a fast, chaotic melody that sows panic in the minds of your foes, forcing each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can hear you to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t frightened. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
				<li><strong>Mithrallica.</strong> You unleash an ear-shattering power chord that blows your foes away, forcing each creature in a 25-foot cone to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 thunder damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you, knocked prone, and deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the deafened condition on itself on a success.</li>

		<description>
			<p>Burning with ravenous hunger and unquenchable hanger, this mimic-infused weapon struggles relentlessly against the sturdy iron chains that bind it. Loosening the chains stimulates the weapon’s digestive juices which, if not quenched, can have caustic consequences for its wielder.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Mimic Unleashed.</em></strong> As a bonus action while holding the hammer, you can loosen the chains restraining the mimic, leaving it free to mercilessly maul your foes. While the chains are loose, the hammer bites targets that it hits, dealing an extra 1d4 piercing damage.</p>
			<p>If you end your turn holding the hammer while the chains are loose, and you didn’t hit a creature with an attack using the hammer that turn, the hammer’s excess digestive juices pour down the handle and you take 1d4 acid damage. The chains tighten on their own if the hammer isn’t held for 1 minute or if you use a bonus action to tighten the chains while holding the weapon.</p>

A creature covered in bile takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the bile off. Increase this acid damage to 2d4 if the chains were loose when the hammer hit.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This weapon is naturally attracted to foes bearing ferrous metals, allowing it to strike them with more force. Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.</p>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against targets made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Optional Attunement.</em></strong> If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction property. When you activate a property granted by this optional attunement, roll a d4. On a 1, haemstrike’s optional attunement properties can’t be activated until the next dawn.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Attraction.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 300 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armour, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Large or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>

Those who align themselves more closely with the weapon are granted the ability to manipulate gravity, telekinetically pulling creatures and objects into range of its jagged-faced swings.</p>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If the target is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armour, increase the bonus to +3.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Optional Attunement.</em></strong> If you choose to attune to this weapon, it gains the Attraction and Magnetic Shockwave properties.

			<p><strong><em>Attraction.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can point haemstrike at a target you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target is an object that weighs less than 600 pounds, the object is pulled up to 15 feet towards you. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet straight towards you. If the creature is made of ferrous metal or is wearing ferrous armour, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. Huge or larger creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Magnetic Shockwave.</em></strong> Once per turn when you hit a target with haemstrike, you can cause an eruption of supercooled magnetite shards. Each creature other than you within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Creatures made of ferrous metal or wearing ferrous armour have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack using longspike within the next minute, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical hyphae for 1 minute. An affected creature can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. After you activate this property, roll a d6. On a 1-2, you can’t activate this property again until the following dawn.</p>

			<p>An ostentatiously ornate tommybow, the goldleaf bows are decorated with an array of bedazzling jewels. Rubies and sapphires sparkle with the fire and ice of the Hells, emeralds carry a vitriolic venom, and the diamonds glow with warm, bright sunlight, a delight peculiar to the pygmy rakshasa.</p>
			<p>This tommybow consists of five vertically stacked bows, each of which sports a pair of matched, randomly determined gemstones. Roll a d4 to determine each bow’s gemstone pairs: 1, diamonds; 2, emeralds; 3, rubies; 4, sapphires.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Rakshasa’s Revenge.</em></strong> You can use an action to imbue a piece of ammunition with one of the following spells (save DC 15) and fire the ammunition at a point or target within range: <i>daylight</i> (diamond), <i>fireball</i> (ruby), <i>sleet storm</i> (sapphire), or <i>stench</i> (emerald; see page 515). When the ammunition hits a target or surface, it unleashes the imbued spell centred on that point. These spells do not require concentration. You can choose to fire at a point on a surface or at a target; if you miss the target, the effect is centred on whichever surface the ammunition hits (GM’s discretion). The gems are destroyed when the spell is cast and their pieces fall to the ground.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Recharge.</em></strong> You can spend 1 minute replacing a pair of gemstones with diamonds, emeralds, rubies, or sapphires worth at least 100 gp each. So long as the gemstones are matching, then, at the next dawn, they sparkle with arcane power and can be used to imbue the bolts with the associated spells.</p>

On a failed save, the target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is desiccated for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t desiccated. A desiccated creature’s skin turns dry and brittle, rupturing with ease, and causing the creature to take an additional 1d4 slashing damage whenever it takes bludgeoning, force, piercing, slashing, or thunder damage. A desiccated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property has no effect on creatures without skin or on those immune to necrotic damage.</p>

Until reformed as a sword as a bonus action, this weapon loses its former sword properties and gains those of a whip.</p>

With a lengthy reload time and complete lack of accuracy, this matchlock-augmented polearm is usable at only one range: point blank. It also comes with a lovely ribbon and a neat basket to hold all your spare shot. Cute.</p>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Point Blank Shot.</em></strong> When you hit a target with an attack using a loaded gunnspier, you can use a bonus action to pull the trigger, firing a plum-sized leaden ball at the target. The attack deals an additional 2d8 bludgeoning damage. As an action, you can reload the gunnspier.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Backfire.</em></strong> When you use Point Blank Shot and roll an 8 on both of the additional bludgeoning damage dice, the gunnspier backfires. Each creature within 10 feet of you (including you) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage as shrapnel erupts from the weapon.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Something about this cobbled-together, wrist-mounted, bow-like contraption looks wrong. It shouldn’t hold together. There’s nothing even holding the string in place. It must be magic. There’s no writing on it but, if there was, you feel it’d be written as: “Kobbold RystBo.”</p>
			<p><strong><em>Handsfree.</em></strong> The kobold wristbow does not require a free hand to hold or fire.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Quickshot.</em></strong> In response to your mental command, you can release the bowstring and make a ranged weapon attack with the loaded wristbow as a bonus action. You must reload a wristbow before firing again.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> You can reload the kobold wristbow using either a bonus action or an action. This requires at least 1 free hand.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Forged as a pair, these magic weapons are crafted from the matching upper and lower jaw bones of a tarrasque. Their innate magic—and one of the reasons the tar-rasque’s bite is so powerful—creates an arcanomagnetic pull between the two jawbones, dealing devastating damage to whatever lies between them.</p>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with each of these magic weapons. These weapons deal piercing damage instead of their usual damage type.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Chomp.</em></strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting using these two weapons and hit the same target with both weapons, the attack you make with your second weapon deals an additional 1d8 damage.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Optional Attunement.</em></strong> You can choose to attune to a pair of jaw breakers. They count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. When you do so, the weapons gain the Swirling Dervish property while you are attuned to them.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Swirling Dervish.</em></strong> Harnessing the power of the blades, you leap over a target, becoming a tornado of lacerating blades. As an action while you wield both jaw breakers, you can perform a magically-enhanced jump, attacking creatures you pass over. This jump has a maximum distance of 20 feet, is a straight line, must end in an unoccupied space, does not provoke opportunity attacks, and each foot you clear on the jump costs one foot of movement. You can make one attack against a creature under you in each 5-foot space over which you jump. These attacks always alternate main-hand, then off-hand.</p>
			<p>For example, if you jumped over one Huge creature, you could make three attacks against it (the second one dealing Chomp’s extra damage on a hit). If you jumped over three Medium creatures, you could make one attack against each (with no extra damage from Chomp).</p>

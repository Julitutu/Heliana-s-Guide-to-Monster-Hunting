##Additional content from Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting Setting to extend Aurora.

Hello everyone! I'm releasing Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting for Aurora. I've already done all the tests for all races, classes, most feats and items.

I'm still working and testing companions/familiars.

Also, I'm still thinking about what the best approach is to write the Tamer class.
